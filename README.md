# KWL (Know What Learn) Application

This prototype is intended to provide teachers with a KWL support tool, which accommodates class sizes typically between twenty-five and thirty students. In order to reflect the number of students in such a class, and provide a realistic representation of an e-learning environment, a total of twelve students were created and divided into four separate teams. The usernames, team names and passwords for each student are given in the table below.

|Username|Team |Password  |
|---     |---  |---       |
|Mike    |phi  |mike123   |
|Claire  |phi  |claire123 |
|Sam     |phi  |sam123    |
|Paul    |omega|paul123   |
|Zak     |omega|zak123    |
