This prototype is intended to provide secondary school teachers with a KWL support tool, which accommodates class sizes typically between twenty-five and thirty students. In order to reflect the number of students in such a class, and provide a realistic representation of an e-learning environment, a total of twelve students were created and divided into four separate teams. The usernames, team names and passwords for each student are given in the table below.

|Username|Team |Password  |   |Username|Team |Password |
|---     |---  |---       |---|---     |---  |---      |
