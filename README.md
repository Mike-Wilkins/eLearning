# KWL (Know What Learn) Application

The design structure and inspiration for this prototype is primarily based on Donna Ogleâ€™s original vision of the KWL model. Concepts surrounding the development and facilitation of student inquiry, self-evaluation, independent learning and methods for supporting collaborative and co-operative work ethics, were considered throughout each design stage of the KWL prototype.
